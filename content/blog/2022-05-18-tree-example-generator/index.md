I made a tool for generating random operation sequences (insertion/removal) for trees (2-3-4 tree, Red-Black tree, AVL etc.). You can access it from [https://bsahin.xyz/misc/tree](/misc/tree)

Note to self: I should get around forking `hugo-theme-terminal` to accomodate for listing pages from multiple sections at some point (otherwise stuff not in `blog/` remains invisible).
