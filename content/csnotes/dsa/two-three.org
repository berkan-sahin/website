- Definition :: A tree where all leaf nodes are at the same level, and where each node has either two or three children
* Properties of 2-3 trees
- They are never taller than a minimum-height BST
- A 2-3 tree of height h always has at least $2^h-1$ nodes
* Formal definition of a 2-3 tree
T is a 2-3 tree of height $h$ if
- T is empty ( $h = 0$ )
- T has a root with a single data item $k$ and two children, which are also 2-3 trees, where
   - The left child of the root only contains items $< k$
   - The right child of the root only contains items $> k$
   - Both children should have height $h - 1$
- T has a root with two data items $a$ and $b$ and three children, which are also 2-3 tres, where
   - The left child only contains items $< a$
   - The middle child contains items between $a$ and $b$
   - The right child only contains items $> b$
   - All children have height $h - 1$
* TODO implementation notes
* Searching on a 2-3 tree
- Similar to search on a BST
- In the 3-node case, compare with both keys and decide on next node to look for a key $k$
  1. If $k < a$, move to the left child
  2. If $a < k < b$, move to the middle child
  3. If $b < k$, move to the right child
- The complexity is always $O(\log{n})$ where $n$ is the number of nodes in the tree
* In-order traversal of a 2-3 tree
- Almost the same as traversing a BST
** 2-nodes
  1. visit left child
  2. Visit data
  3. Visit right child
** 3-nodes
  1. Visit left child
  2. Visit smaller data
  3. Visit mid child
  4. Visit larger data
  5. Visit right child
* Insertion into a 2-3 tree
** Into a 2-node leaf
- Make the leaf a 3-node
** Into a 3-node leaf
- We need to split the node
** TODO Splitting a node
*** Splitting a leaf
- Move the middle item into the parent
- Larger and smaller items become children
- Need to split the parent as well if the parent is a 3-node
*** Splitting an internal node
- Middle item moves into the parent
- Smaller and larger items become the children of the parent
