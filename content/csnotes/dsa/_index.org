* A pretty important note
These notes are pretty disorganized at the moment, I shall (hopefully) extend some sections as I 
go through the document (which can take a few days, since the document is approximately 1.1K lines long, not
counting heaps and AVL trees). I am posting these because they /might/ be useful to someone, but I give
no guarantees on that regard.

* Study resources
These two sites contain problems that can help with the exams, interviews for jobs/internships and your problem solving skills in general
