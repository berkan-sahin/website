Hi! I am Berkan Åžahin. I like to break and tinker with things (and sometimes fix them). I'm currently studying Computer Science/Engineering at Bilkent University. (note to self: write a bit more about yourself)

## Contact info
I prefer using e-mail for communication. My e-mail addresses are:
- `berkan[at]bsahin.xyz` (Primary/personal e-mail)
- `berkan.sahin[at]ug.bilkent.edu.tr` (University e-mail)

Unless your message requires an official university e-mail, please use the first e-mail address as I check it more often (especially during summer).
